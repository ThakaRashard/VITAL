Derivation of the Equation
===========================

To derive the final equation, we start with the initial equation:

\[
E = mc^2
\]

1. **Step 1**: Consider the relationship between energy and mass. We can express energy in terms of momentum:
   \[
   E = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + m^2c^4}
   \]

2. **Step 2**: Rearranging the equation gives us:
   \[
   E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4
   \]

3. **Step 3**: If we set \( p = 0 \) (the rest mass energy), we simplify to:
   \[
   E^2 = m^2c^4
   \]

4. **Step 4**: Taking the square root of both sides results in:
   \[
   E = mc^2
   \]

Thus, we arrive at the final equation:
\[
E = mc^2
\]
